# CYPRESS_Co-Simulation _Platform
The CYPRESS project (Cyber-Physical Risk of the bulk Electric Energy Supply System) aims at developing novel knowledge, methods and tools needed to help ensure the security of supply through the transmission grid, while accounting for the specific nature of cyber-threats and integrating them into a coherent probabilistic risk management approach.
